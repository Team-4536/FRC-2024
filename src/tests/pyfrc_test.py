# pyfrc.test run through disabled, teleop, auto, then back to disabled and looks for crash bugs.  Doesn't test inputs or much else.
# We can write additional tests to verify our code still works after changes.

# You can read more about pyfrc.test's here: https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/projects/pyfrc/en/stable/testing.html
